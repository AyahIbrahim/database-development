# 📚☕🎦🎶 Beyond Borders: Books and More - Database Development

Welcome to the *Beyond Borders: Books and More* database project! This repository showcases the comprehensive work done to create a centralized master database for a fictional chain of bookstores based in California. The goal was to replace the existing vendor-based systems with a robust, scalable solution that covers all key business operations.
Project Overview

## 🛠️ Project Background
*Beyond Borders*, a chain of five bookstores, is undergoing a digital transformation. Under the leadership of their new CEO, the company is moving towards a centralized "world brain" database. This project forms the backbone of that transformation, laying out the framework to manage essential areas such as:

• *Books:* Manage book-related details, including inventory and sales.

•	*Sales:* Track and analyze sales transactions across all locations.

•	*Café:* Handle café operations, including menu items and sales.

•	*Staff:* Maintain employee records, shift hours, and payroll data.

## 🚀 Extra Credit Expansion
The database also provides the foundation for potential future expansions into areas such as:

•	*Products, Publishers, and Vendors:* Detailed management of suppliers for books, music, movies, and merchandise.

•	*Music, Movies, and Merch:* Extend the inventory management system to these categories.

## 📊 Key Views & Analytics
To provide actionable insights, the database includes predefined views that offer a comprehensive look at the business:

•	*Store Inventory:* Keep track of the available stock at each store.

•	*Store Sales:* Monitor sales performance on a store-by-store basis.

•	*Company-Wide Sales/Stock Data:* Get an aggregated view of sales and stock levels across all locations.

•	*Employee Hours:* Record and analyze the working hours of employees.

•	*Weekly Store Profits:* Calculate weekly profits for each store by considering sales and staff costs

## 🪜 Project Structure
• *ER Diagram:* Visual representation of entities and their relationships using the [ERDPlus Tool](https://erdplus.com/).

• *SQL Scripts:* SQL code for creating tables, importing data, and generating views.
• *Mock Data:* Fictional data generated using [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/) for creativity and testing purposes.
• *Documentation:* Detailed steps taken to complete each part of the project, along with challenges faced and solutions implemented.

## 💡 Challenges & Lessons Learned
Every project has its hurdles. Here are a few we overcame:

• *Data Integration Issues:* I had to ensure unique product IDs across categories—books, café items, movies, and music—to prevent data conflicts.
• *File Permissions:* I tackled permission errors during data imports by adjusting file locations.

## 🎯 Why This Matters
By centralizing data, Beyond Borders can:

• *Improve Operational Efficiency:* Real-time access to data helps in managing inventory and sales more effectively.
• *Enhance Customer Experience:* With better stock management, customers always find what they’re looking for.
• *Scale Seamlessly:* The database is built to accommodate future business needs.
